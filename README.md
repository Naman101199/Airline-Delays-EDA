FINAL PROJECT
Objectives 
• End to end process of gathering, preparing and storing data in a relational database
• Analyzing data and creating reports and dashboards to enable business decision making
• Articulation of business case and team collaboration on data preparation and analysis
Project
The goal behind the final project is to ‘put it all together’ by developing a coherent, concise, and realistic analysis in 
the form of a report and presentation to an executive audience (your client). The project will provide you with the 
opportunity to apply your knowledge and understanding of data collection, storage in a relational database, analysis
and visualization, by identifying a dataset, analyzing the data, and providing recommendations to your client. 
The project report should contain the following sections and be written for the intended executive audience in 
mind:
• Executive summary
• Research objective(s) 
o The problem to be solved and data you plan on using 
• Methodology and various tools used in the process
o At least 5 relational database tables (3NF+), EER diagram
o Additionally you may also use a No-SQL database to store some of the data
• Data analysis and Visualization
o Insights using at least 4 moderately complex SQL queries
o Insights using at least 4 reports and a dashboard/storyboard
• Recommendations
o Corrective measures and scope for improvement
• Lessons Learned
Data
Students may use any moderately sized public dataset (see samples below):
• https://data.cityofchicago.org/ 
• https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
• https://data.gov.in/catalogs
• https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

Final Project
Project Timelines
• Week 1: Form project teams 
• Week 2: Research and socialize project ideas and scope
• Week 3: Finalize project data sources and datasets
• Week 4: Create conceptual and logical ER model
• Week 5: Finalize and review EER model 
• Week 6: Complete loading data into relational (and non-relational if any) schema
• Week 7: Create and test SQL queries 
• Week 8: Create visualization and dashboards
• Week 9: Present findings and recommendations
• Week 10: Present findings and recommendations
• Upload all submissions to course portal within 3 days of final presentation
Submissions 
• Students will work in teams of 3 to 4 members
• Teams may be asked to present their projects in the final sync session through video/screenshare
• Following artifacts to be subitted as a single submission per team:
o Enhanced Entity Relatonship (EER) model (sql workbench file or screenshot)
o SQL script file containing all important analysis queries
o Visualization Dashboards/Reports – Tableau, Excel or PowerBI, etc. (raw files)
o Final Presentation slides (as pptx or pdf)
Grading Rubric
The final team project accounts for 40% of your overall grade, and project grade will be determined based on:
• Business Use Case - 20%
o Understanding the business problem and articulating projects goals
• Data Preparation - 20%
o Data extraction, cleaning, normalization
• Relational Modeling - 20%
o Conceptual and logical ER model
• Relational Database Implementation - 20 %
o EER, database creation and data loading
• Reporting and Visualization -20%
o Insights gained through SQL analysis, reports and dashboards
