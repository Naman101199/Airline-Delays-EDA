# FINAL PROJECT <br />

Objectives <br />
• End to end process of gathering, preparing and storing data in a relational database <br />
• Analyzing data and creating reports and dashboards to enable business decision making <br />
• Articulation of business case and team collaboration on data preparation and analysis <br />

Project <br />

The goal behind the final project is to ‘put it all together’ by developing a coherent, concise, and realistic analysis in 
the form of a report and presentation to an executive audience (your client). The project will provide you with the 
opportunity to apply your knowledge and understanding of data collection, storage in a relational database, analysis
and visualization, by identifying a dataset, analyzing the data, and providing recommendations to your client. <br />
The project report should contain the following sections and be written for the intended executive audience in 
mind: <br />

• Executive summary <br />
• Research objective(s) <br />
• The problem to be solved and data you plan on using  <br />
• Methodology and various tools used in the process <br />
• At least 5 relational database tables (3NF+), EER diagram <br />
• Additionally you may also use a No-SQL database to store some of the data <br />
• Data analysis and Visualization <br />
• Insights using at least 4 moderately complex SQL queries <br />
• Insights using at least 4 reports and a dashboard/storyboard <br />
• Recommendations <br />
• Corrective measures and scope for improvement <br />
• Lessons Learned <br />

Data <br />
Students may use any moderately sized public dataset (see samples below): <br />
• https://data.cityofchicago.org/ <br />
• https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ <br />
• https://data.gov.in/catalogs <br />

Final Project <br />

Project Timelines <br />
• Week 1: Form project teams  <br />
• Week 2: Research and socialize project ideas and scope <br />
• Week 3: Finalize project data sources and datasets <br />
• Week 4: Create conceptual and logical ER model <br />
• Week 5: Finalize and review EER model <br />
• Week 6: Complete loading data into relational (and non-relational if any) schema <br />
• Week 7: Create and test SQL queries <br />
• Week 8: Create visualization and dashboards <br />
• Week 9: Present findings and recommendations <br />
• Week 10: Present findings and recommendations <br />
• Upload all submissions to course portal within 3 days of final presentation <br />

Submissions <br />
• Students will work in teams of 3 to 4 members <br />
• Teams may be asked to present their projects in the final sync session through video/screenshare <br />
• Following artifacts to be subitted as a single submission per team: <br />
• Enhanced Entity Relatonship (EER) model (sql workbench file or screenshot) <br />
• SQL script file containing all important analysis queries <br />
• Visualization Dashboards/Reports – Tableau, Excel or PowerBI, etc. (raw files) <br />
• Final Presentation slides (as pptx or pdf) <br />

Grading Rubric <br />
The final team project accounts for 40% of your overall grade, and project grade will be determined based on: <br />
• Business Use Case - 20% <br />
		Understanding the business problem and articulating projects goals <br />
• Data Preparation - 20% <br />
		Data extraction, cleaning, normalization <br />
• Relational Modeling - 20% <br />
		Conceptual and logical ER model <br />
• Relational Database Implementation - 20 % <br />
		EER, database creation and data loading <br />
• Reporting and Visualization -20% <br />
		Insights gained through SQL analysis, reports and dashboards
